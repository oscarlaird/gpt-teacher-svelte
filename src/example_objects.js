"name": "Native American Societies Before European Contact",
"overview": "<p>Before the arrival of Europeans, diverse <b>Native American societies</b> thrived across North America, each with its own unique culture, economic system, and political organization. In the Eastern Woodlands region, groups such as the <b>Iroquois</b> and <b>Algonquian</b> peoples established complex societies, with the Iroquois Confederacy being a notable example of a democratic political structure. </p><p>The <b>Mississippian culture</b>, which flourished between 800 and 1600 CE, built impressive cities and ceremonial centers, such as <b>Cahokia</b> in present-day Illinois. Cahokia, at its peak around 1250 CE, was home to an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people and featured the massive <b>Monks Mound</b>, the largest earthen mound in North America.</p><p>In the Southwest, the <b>Ancestral Puebloans</b> constructed complex cliff dwellings, such as those found at <b>Mesa Verde</b> in present-day Colorado, and developed advanced agricultural techniques, including the cultivation of maize, beans, and squash. The Ancestral Puebloans thrived between 600 and 1300 CE, with their descendants forming the modern Pueblo peoples.</p><p>On the Great Plains, nomadic tribes like the <b>Lakota</b> and <b>Comanche</b> relied on the vast buffalo herds for food, clothing, and shelter. The introduction of the horse in the late 1600s, following the arrival of Europeans, dramatically transformed their way of life and led to greater mobility and more effective hunting practices.</p><p>The Pacific Northwest Coast was home to groups like the <b>Tlingit</b> and <b>Haida</b>, who developed a rich culture based on fishing, hunting, and gathering. These groups built large cedar plank houses and were known for their totem poles and potlatches, elaborate gift-giving ceremonies that redistributed wealth and reaffirmed social status.</p><p>In summary, pre-Columbian Native American societies displayed a wide array of cultural, economic, and political structures. Understanding these diverse groups and their ways of life is essential for appreciating the complexity and richness of the history of North America before European contact.</p>",

"overview": "<p>European exploration and early settlements in the Americas were driven by various motivations, including economic, religious, and political factors.

French settlements were characterized by fur trading posts and missionary efforts, with <b>Jesuit missionaries</b> seeking to convert the native population to Catholicism.</p> <p><b>English</b> exploration and colonization began later than the Spanish and French efforts, driven by a combination of religious and economic motivations.
