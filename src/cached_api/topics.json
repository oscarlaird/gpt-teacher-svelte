The \u003cb\u003eVirginia House of Burgesses\u003c/b\u003e passed a series of laws in the 1660s and 1670s, including the \u003cb\u003ecasual killing act\u003c/b\u003e, which established a legal foundation for slavery and allowed for the harsh punishment and control of enslaved people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlavery became an integral part of the colonial economy, particularly in the \u003cb\u003eSouth\u003c/b\u003e, where the cash crop economy, centered on \u003cb\u003etobacco\u003c/b\u003e, \u003cb\u003erice\u003c/b\u003e, and \u003cb\u003eindigo\u003c/b\u003e, relied heavily on the labor of enslaved people.

The \u003cb\u003eTriangular Trade\u003c/b\u003e further fueled the growth of slavery, as European goods were exchanged for African slaves, who were then transported across the Atlantic to the Americas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eResistance to slavery took various forms, including both active and passive resistance. Enslaved people resisted their oppression through acts of sabotage, escape, and revolts, such as the \u003cb\u003eStono Rebellion\u003c/b\u003e in 1739. Despite the brutal suppression of these revolts, they demonstrated the resilience and determination of enslaved people to challenge their bondage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlavery also had a significant impact on the development of colonial society, contributing to the development of a rigid racial hierarchy and a culture of white supremacy.

Salutary neglect was an unofficial and unspoken policy, which led to minimal British interference in the colonies' internal affairs, particularly in regard to trade and governance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSalutary neglect arose for several reasons, including British preoccupation with European affairs, a desire to foster colonial economic growth, and the relative distance between Britain and its American colonies. This policy allowed the colonies to develop their own systems of governance, with most adopting \u003cb\u003eroyal, proprietary, or charter governments\u003c/b\u003e. Royal colonies were directly controlled by the British Crown, with governors appointed by the king. Proprietary colonies were governed by a proprietor, who was granted land by the king and had significant authority over the colony. Charter governments were established through royal charters, which granted certain rights and privileges to the colonists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout this period, colonial assemblies became more powerful and influential.

However, enforcement of these acts was inconsistent and often lax, leading to widespread smuggling and a general disregard for British trade regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe period of salutary neglect came to an end in the mid-18th century, as the British government began to take a more active role in colonial affairs following the \u003cb\u003eFrench and Indian War\u003c/b\u003e (1754-1763).

The rocky soil and harsh climate made large-scale farming difficult, so families often practiced subsistence farming, growing crops primarily for their own consumption. The region's abundant forests provided timber for shipbuilding, which became a significant industry. Additionally, the plentiful coastal waters made fishing a major economic activity, particularly the harvesting of cod.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cb\u003eMiddle Colonies\u003c/b\u003e had a more diversified economy, with a mix of agriculture, manufacturing, and trade.

The Middle Colonies became known as the \"\u003cb\u003ebreadbasket colonies\u003c/b\u003e\" due to their role in feeding the other colonies.

The labor-intensive nature of these crops led to the widespread use of enslaved labor, a practice that would have long-lasting consequences for American society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe social structure of the colonies was shaped by factors such as economic opportunities and religious beliefs. In New England, \u003cb\u003ePuritan\u003c/b\u003e values emphasized hard work, education, and a strong sense of community. As a result, the region developed a more egalitarian society, with a larger middle class and fewer extremes of wealth and poverty. In contrast, the Southern Colonies developed a more hierarchical society, with a small number of wealthy planters at the top, a larger class of small farmers and tradespeople in the middle, and a significant population of enslaved Africans at the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the colonies, the economy and society were interconnected and shaped by the unique conditions and resources of each region.

The \u003cb\u003eTenth Amendment\u003c/b\u003e reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people, emphasizing the principle of federalism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the Bill of Rights, several other early amendments were proposed but not ratified. The most notable of these is the proposed \u003cb\u003eTwelfth Amendment\u003c/b\u003e, which was eventually ratified in 1804. The Twelfth Amendment modified the electoral process for choosing the president and vice president by having electors cast separate votes for each office, thus preventing electoral deadlocks like the one that occurred in the election of 1800 between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, the Bill of Rights and early amendments reflect the Founding Fathers' efforts to create a balanced government that would protect individual liberties while allowing for an effective and functional federal system.\u003c/p\u003e","unit_id":3},{"id":19,"image_name":"oregon_trail_pioneers.jpg","name":"Manifest Destiny","unit_id":4},{"id":20,"image_name":"treaty_of_guadalupe_hidalgo.jpg","name":"The Mexican-American War","unit_id":4},{"id":21,"image_name":"sutters_mill.jpg","name":"The Gold Rush and Westward Expansion","unit_id":4},{"id":22,"image_name":"lowell_mill_girls.jpg","name":"The Industrial Revolution in America","unit_id":4},{"id":23,"image_name":"transcontinental_railroad.jpg","name":"Transportation and Communication Advances","unit_id":4},{"id":24,"image_name":"erie_canal.jpg","name":"The Market Revolution","unit_id":4},{"id":25,"image_name":"african_slave_ship.jpg","name":"The Origins of Slavery and the Middle Passage","unit_id":5},{"id":26,"image_name":"harriet_tubman_underground_rr.jpg","name":"Abolitionist Movement","unit_id":5},{"id":27,"image_name":"henry_clay.jpg","name":"Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act","unit_id":5},{"id":28,"image_name":"john_brown_harpers_ferry.jpg","name":"Kansas-Nebraska Act and Bleeding Kansas","unit_id":5},{"id":29,"image_name":"dred_scott_portrait.jpg","name":"Dred Scott Decision","unit_id":5},{"id":30,"image_name":"lincoln_election.jpg","name":"Election of 1860 and Secession","unit_id":5},{"id":31,"image_name":"fort_sumter_attack.jpg","name":"The Civil War: Causes, Major Battles, and Strategies","unit_id":6},{"id":32,"image_name":"abraham_lincoln_emancipation.jpg","name":"Emancipation Proclamation","unit_id":6},{"id":33,"image_name":"gettysburg_address_lincoln.jpg","name":"Gettysburg Address","unit_id":6},{"id":34,"image_name":"andrew_johnson_veto.jpg","name":"Reconstruction Plans","unit_id":6},{"id":35,"image_name":"15th_amendment.jpg","name":"The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments","unit_id":6},{"id":36,"image_name":"reconstruction_cartoon.jpg","name":"End of Reconstruction and the Compromise of 1877","unit_id":6},{"id":37,"image_name":"rockefeller_oil.jpg","name":"The Gilded Age: Industrialists and Urbanization","unit_id":7},{"id":38,"image_name":"william_jennings_bryan.jpg","name":"The Populist Movement","unit_id":7},{"id":39,"image_name":"teddy_roosevelt","name":"Progressive Reforms and Leaders","unit_id":7},{"id":40,"image_name":"upton_sinclair_jungle.jpg","name":"The Progressive Era: Muckrakers and Social Change","unit_id":7},{"id":41,"image_name":"alice_paul_suffragist.jpg","name":"Women's Suffrage Movement","unit_id":7},{"id":42,"image_name":"roosevelt_conservation.jpg","name":"Theodore Roosevelt and the Square Deal","unit_id":7},{"id":43,"image_name":"zimmermann_telegram.jpg","name":"World War I: Causes, Major Battles, and the Homefront","unit_id":8},{"id":44,"image_name":"flappers_dancing.jpg","name":"The Roaring Twenties","unit_id":8},{"id":45,"image_name":"bread_line.jpg","name":"The Great Depression: Causes and Impact","unit_id":8},{"id":46,"image_name":"hoover_dam_construction.jpg","name":"The New Deal: Programs and Impact","unit_id":8},{"id":47,"image_name":"dust_storm.jpg","name":"Dust Bowl and Migration","unit_id":8},{"id":48,"image_name":"langston_hughes_poet.jpg","name":"Cultural Changes and the Harlem Renaissance","unit_id":8},{"id":49,"image_name":"pearl_harbor_attack.jpg","name":"World War II: Causes, Major Battles, and the Homefront","unit_id":9},{"id":50,"image_name":"liberation_of_concentration_camp.jpg","name":"The Holocaust and America's Response","unit_id":9},{"id":51,"image_name":"hiroshima_bombing.jpg","name":"The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II","unit_id":9},{"id":52,"image_name":"berlin_wall.jpg","name":"The Cold War: Origins and Containment","unit_id":9},{"id":53,"image_name":"korean_war_soldiers.jpg","name":"The Korean War and the Vietnam War","unit_id":9},{"id":54,"image_name":"apollo_11_moon_landing.jpg","name":"The Space Race and the Arms Race","unit_id":9},{"id":55,"image_name":"martin_luther_king_jr_i_have_a_dream.jpg","name":"The Civil Rights Movement: Key Events and Leaders","unit_id":10},{"id":56,"image_name":"little_rock_nine.jpg","name":"Brown v.
