    <h2>About the Study Tool</h2>
    <p>
      Hey there! I created TutorMeGPT/apush, an awesome study tool using GPT-4, to help students like you have a more engaging and effective learning experience. Trust GPT-4 - it scored a 5 on the AP US History exam! This free resource includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>400+</strong> flashcards to quickly review important concepts</li>
      <li><strong>500+</strong> multiple choice questions to test your knowledge</li>
      <li><strong>60</strong> in-depth topic study guides for a deeper understanding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unlike Quizlet, TutorMeGPT/apush offers study guides on every topic, and its multiple-choice tests are completely free. I hope you find this tool super useful in your learning journey. Remember, practice makes perfect!
